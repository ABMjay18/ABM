                            Welcome to my personal website! Here's a little about me:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am passionate about my future goal. With a strong background in Agriculture and MBA knowledge, I am pursuing agribusiness management to improve my managerial and problem-solving skills. Through internships and university projects, I have applied theoretical knowledge to real-world challenges.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my free time, I enjoy reading, traveling on bike at cold weather. I also love connecting with like-minded individuals and sharing my journey.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This website is a reflection of my personal and professional journey. I hope you find it inspiring and insightful!
                        </p>
